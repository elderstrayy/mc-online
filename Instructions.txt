NB: This will only work if you have a valid Minecraft account, and an existing .minecraft folder on your pc.
*This is not a way to get Minecraft for free*
You can only play minecraft 1.5.2, due to the limitations of a web browser. (An okay pc is required, otherwise it will lag.
*You will need to follow these instructions, otherwise it won't work.*
Instructions:
Download this 21.0 Firefox instaler from the official archive:
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/21.0/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2021.0.exe
Next, install firefox, and go to about:config in the top address bar. It will say something like this "This may void your warranty".
Ignore this warning, do not worry about it. After accepting, it will take you to a complicated looking page. Don't worry, it's easy.
Just type app.update.auto, in the top search bar (not the address bar).
Then, double click the app.update.auto block, and it will change it to false. Close Firefox 21.0
Now, you need to install the *32 bit* version of Java *8*. You can get it here:
https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=246472_2dee051a5d0647d5be72a7c0abff270e
After you have completed the installation, open firefox again.
Now, click on the top left orange block, that says "Firefox"
It will display a list of options. On the right, you will see "Add-ons"
Click on it, and choose plugins. If you see "Java(TM) Platform" in the list, you're all set!
Now, go to the windows search, and type configure java. Open the app, and go to the security tab. Keep that open.
Then, go to firefox and then go to http://mc-online.gq
It will show you some warnings about blocked things.
To fix these, follow these steps:
Go back to the java config.
In the site exception list, click edit site list.
Click add. in the new box paste this inside:
http://mc-online.gq/Mine.html
Press enter, then click add, then paste this link:
https://s3.amazonaws.com
Press enter, then click add, then paste this:
file:/
If any warnings pop up, click continue.
Click ok after adding everything, and then ok again.
Now you can go back and reload http://mc-online.gq
Java will warn you about things, so just check the box saying something like "I accept....." and then click run.
Now, you can run Minecraft 1.5.2, right in your browser!
